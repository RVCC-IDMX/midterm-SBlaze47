        Journey to the Center of the Earth (or
        <span lang="fr">Voyage au centre de la Terre</span> in its original
        French) is an 1864 science fiction novel by Jules Gabriel Verne, and is
        considered an exemplar of the genre of subterranean fiction. The story
        involves German professor
        <span class="character">Otto Lidenbrock</span> who believes there are
        volcanic tubes going toward the center of the Earth. Guided by a
        mysterious runic cryptogram he, his nephew
        <span class="character">Axel</span>, and their guide
        <span class="character">Hans</span> descend into the Icelandic volcano
        <span lang="is">Snæfellsjökull</span>, encountering many adventures,
        including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually
        coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the
        <span lang="it">Stromboli</span> volcano.

        The book was inspired by Charles Lyell's
        <em>Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man</em> of 1863 (and
        probably also influenced by Lyell's earlier ground-breaking work
        <em>Principles of Geology</em>, published 1830–33). By that time
        geologists had abandoned a literal biblical account of Earth's
        development and it was generally thought that the end of the last
        glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew
        on new findings to put the origin of human beings much further back in
        the deep geological past. Lyell's book also influenced Louis Figuier's
        1867 second edition of
        <span lang="fr">La Terre avant le déluge</span> ("The Earth before the
        flood") which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women
        wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of
        Eden shown in the 1863 edition.

      <p>The main characters of Verne's work include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="character">Professor Otto Lidenbrock</span>: a professor
          of geology.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="character">Axel</span>: the nephew of Professor
          Lidenbrock, overcautious and unadventurous student.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="character">Hans Bjelke</span>: a Danish-speaking
          Icelandic <span lang="id">eiderduck</span> hunter who becomes their
          guide; dependable, resourceful and imperturbable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="character">Gräuben</span>: the goddaughter of Professor
          Lidenbrock with whom Axel is in love, from the Vierlande area of
          Hamburg.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="character">Martha</span>: the maid at the house of
          Professor Lidenbrock.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is noteworthy that at the time of writing Verne had no hesitation
        with having sympathetic German protagonists with whom the reader could
        identify. Verne's attitude to Germans would drastically change in the
        aftermath of the 1871 Franco-Prussian War. After 1871, the sympathetic
        if eccentric Professor Otto Lidenbrock would be replaced in Verne's
        fiction by the utterly evil and demonic Professor Schultze of The
        Begum's Fortune.

        The first English edition was published in its entirety by Henry Vickers
        in 12 installments of a Boys magazine entitled "The Boys Journal". The
        plates are more numerous than the book form which was published with an
        1872 title page. If it was released in 1871 as a single volume it was
        late in the year. This "True" first edition also found in an octavo
        normal book size (not Annual size), has been overlooked by
        bibliographers. It has a place of pre-eminence up to about a 3rd of the
        way through the 12 monthly issues and then slides down into the main
        body of the journal. The Magazine does not seem to have survived in its
        loose format of 12 individual parts.
